### **About This Repository**

This repo offers fully functional Python scripts oriented around extracting your Google search history. The input is the HTML file Google provides—always named **“MyActivity”** when you download your data.

Inside you’ll find two approaches:

1. A script you can run directly in your IDE (I used VS Code, but feel free to try others) that outputs results right in your coding environment.
2. A Jupyter notebook for exploring and visualizing the results with more flexibility.

### **Why Explore This**

I’m a self-proclaimed tech nerd with a background in spatial analysis, and though I only had an introductory start with coding, I quickly became hooked. I love translating everyday interactions—like search behavior—into insightful patterns. This code set helps you see your own search history in a new light: discover patterns, uncover blind spots, and perhaps turn your past habits into something meaningful.

As the saying goes, *“We live forward but learn backward.”* These scripts give you the tools to learn from your own digital footprint and make better-informed decisions moving forward.

### **Looking Ahead**

In today’s age of digital literacy, data is more than info—it’s insight. We're navigating a VUCA world:

* **Volatility**: constant, often abrupt change
* **Uncertainty**: limited predictability
* **Complexity**: tangled systems and dependencies
* **Ambiguity**: unclear or contradictory signals ([techtarget.com][1], [forbes.com][2], [ods.consulting][3], [medium.com][4], [myframework.net][5])

By mapping your search data, you gain a data-driven compass tailored to your own experience. You can chart a course that’s intelligent and adaptive, even amid external chaos.

Let’s **use tech for good**—one data point at a time.
